Search Images from Twitter, and do favorite.
That's All.

You can follow all your favorite keyword with ease.

## Motivation for creating this app.

I really like cat and like to see photos of cat.
But twitter does not provide easy way to follow multiple image timeline, so I create it.

## setting up
- Java 8 is required.
- register to fabric using android fabric plugin(this should create `app/fabric.properties`).
- create `secret.properties` which looks like below code.

```
FabricApiKey=YOUR_FABRIC_API_KEY(for Crashlytics)
TwitterApiKey=YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY
TwitterApiSecret=YOUR_TWITTER_API_SECRET
```
